                    <p>The Earth is the third closest planet to the Sun, the densest and fifth largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is also the largest of the four telluric planets. It is sometimes referred to as World or Blue Planet. Home to millions of species of living beings, including humans, the Earth is the only celestial body where the existence of life is known. The planet was formed 4.56 billion years ago, and life appeared on its surface a billion years later. Since then, the Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic factors of the planet, allowing the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of an ozone layer, which, together with the Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful solar radiation, allowing life on the planet. The physical properties of the planet, as well as its geological history and orbit, allowed life to persist during this period. It is believed that Earth could support life for at least another 500 million years.</p>

                    <p>observes radio waves emitted by radio sources, usually through one or a set of large parabolic antennas. The area of astronomy related to the observations made by these radio telescopes is called radioastronomy.</p>

                    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Andromeda</h3>
                    <p>The Andromeda galaxy (Messier 31, NGC 224) is a spiral galaxy located about 2.54 million light years away from Earth, in the direction of the Andromeda constellation. It is the spiral galaxy closest to the Milky Way and its name is derived from the constellation where it is situated, which, in turn, has its name derived from the mythological princess Andromeda. It is the largest galaxy of the Local Group, which also contains our galaxy, the Milky Way, the Triangle galaxy and about 30 other smaller ones. The survey by the Spitzer Space Telescope in 2006 determined that its mass is approximately ~ 0.8-1.512 solar masses while the Milky Way has an estimated mass of 8,511 solar masses. Its stellar population reaches approximately 1 trillion stars and the Milky Way has between 200 and 400 billion stars.</p>
